A live-action series adaptation of the “Twisted Metal” PlayStation game franchise is officially moving forward, Variety has learned.

Sony Pictures Television and PlayStation Productions are developing a series based on the “Twisted Metal” vehicular combat games, the first of which was released in 1995. It was originally reported in 2019 that Sony was interested in developing a series based on the games.

The new series is described as an action comedy, based on an original take by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, the writers behind the “Deadpool” films and “Zombieland.”

“’Twisted Metal’ is one of the most beloved franchises from PlayStation,” said Asad Qizilbash, head of PlayStation Productions. “We are thrilled to have such a great team working on bringing this iconic game to life for the fans.”

The show is about a motor-mouthed outsider who is offered a chance at a better life, but only if he can successfully deliver a, ‘Twisted Metal’ Series From ‘Deadpool’ Writers in the Works at Sony Pictures TV, PlayStation Productions, /news/item/ni63203665, https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/twisted-metal-tv-series-deadpool-writers-1234911825/, 2021-02-22T17:00:45Z
People are awful and capitalism has created a world in which the vulnerable can be exploited for cash. That’s the primary message of J Blakeson’s I Care A Lot. It’s a warning and a lesson, to be sure. It is, however, surprisingly, quite a lot of fun. This blackest-of-the-black satirical thriller ticks along like a meticulously planned heist movie, and while it’s difficult to root for absolutely any of these abhorrent characters, there’s still a perverse pleasure in watching their well-executed plans (and well-planned executions) take shape and pay off.

The dark heart of the movie is Rosamund Pike’s Marla, a “professional guardian” onto an ingenious but completely horrible scam: she gets a doctor to declare elderly patients unfit to take care of themselves, has the court name her their legal guardian, packs them off to be dosed-up in a care home and flogs, I Care a Lot Review, /news/item/ni63203420, https://www.heyuguys.com/i-care-a-lot-review/, 2021-02-22T15:12:57Z

Joe Jonas loves every facet of wife Sophie Turner's personality. In honor of her 25th birthday on Feb. 21, the singer took to Instagram to share two very different photos of the Game of Thrones alum. He included a comical caption referencing the fact that she looks incredibly glam in the first shot, and is quite low-key in the second one that shows her playing with the strings on her hoodie. "Happy Birthday babe," Joe, 31, wrote. "You have two moods and I love them both equally heart emoji] love you @sophiet." Sophie clearly appreciated the sentiment, as she responded with, "I love you."

Jaime Lannister is one of the most popular characters from Game of Thrones that fans both hate and love - largely depending on how far into the show they are. Of course, he’s also one of the best fighters in Westeros, and his reputation as a swordsman is a huge part of his character. Certainly, losing his right hand didn’t help with this, but the King Slayer still has a reputation to uphold.

This article contains I Care a Lot spoilers.

J Blakeson’s I Care a Lot is one of very few films where everyone in it is a villain. In the lead role, Rosamund Pike ushers in a new amoral high mark as conservator con artist Marla Grayson. Peter Dinklage meanwhile mines the standard Hollywood heavy role for an unexpected haul of gangster gravitas. And with his turn as Roman Lunyov, the former black sheep of the Lannister family in Game of Thrones joins the likes of Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando, Wesley Snipes, and Humphrey Bogart as memorable cinema crime bosses.

However, this isn’t Dinklage’s first turn in a mob movie. He got his button in Find Me Guilty (2006). The film was based on the true story of Lucchese crime family soldier Jackie Dinorscio, played by Vin Diesel, and the longest mafia trial in American history.

The villains in the MCU are a surprisingly great reflection of their comic book counterparts — although cinema has a habit of pushing at the boundaries of character traits, motivations, relationships, and so on, they have maintained an incredible similarity with the origin stories. But this isn't necessarily the case all the time.

Ginny & Georgia‘s central twosome are not Lorelai and Rory Gilmore. On the surface level, the new Netflix dramedy (premiering next Wednesday, Feb. 24) is bound to inspire comparisons to the WB/CW series Gilmore Girls, what with its central relationship being between a young thirtysomething mother and her teenage daughter. The show’s trailer even features a scene of Georgia (played by Batwoman‘s Brianne Howey) comparing herself and 15-year-old Ginny (Raising Dion‘s Antonia Gentry) to the beloved Gilmore duo.

Netflix’s Tribes of Europa is a new apocalyptic mystery created by the producers of Dark, W&b Television. The new series arrived on the streaming service on February 19th, with all six episodes available to watch now. Tribes of Europa follows a similar path to that of Dark, film franchise The Hunger Games and hit series Game of Thrones, where families set out with a mammoth mission of saving the world from further catastrophe.

Like many other great Netflix series, Tribes of Europa ends with an agonising cliffhanger. There’s currently no word about a second season, and the first finishes with plenty of questions around the plot. We’ve pulled together the answers to some burning questions below.
