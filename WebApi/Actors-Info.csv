This article contains I Care a Lot spoilers.

J Blakeson’s I Care a Lot is one of very few films where everyone in it is a villain. In the lead role, Rosamund Pike ushers in a new amoral high mark as conservator con artist Marla Grayson. Peter Dinklage meanwhile mines the standard Hollywood heavy role for an unexpected haul of gangster gravitas. And with his turn as Roman Lunyov, the former black sheep of the Lannister family in Game of Thrones joins the likes of Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando, Wesley Snipes, and Humphrey Bogart as memorable cinema crime bosses.

However, this isn’t Dinklage’s first turn in a mob movie. He got his button in Find Me Guilty (2006). The film was based on the true story of Lucchese crime family soldier Jackie Dinorscio, played by Vin Diesel, and the longest mafia trial in American history.

The villains in the MCU are a surprisingly great reflection of their comic book counterparts — although cinema has a habit of pushing at the boundaries of character traits, motivations, relationships, and so on, they have maintained an incredible similarity with the origin stories. But this isn't necessarily the case all the time.

Every fan may not enjoy the specific depiction of their favorite hero or villain, for instance, for altering their narratives in a minor but significant manner.

Ginny & Georgia‘s central twosome are not Lorelai and Rory Gilmore. On the surface level, the new Netflix dramedy (premiering next Wednesday, Feb. 24) is bound to inspire comparisons to the WB/CW series Gilmore Girls, what with its central relationship being between a young thirtysomething mother and her teenage daughter. The show’s trailer even features a scene of Georgia (played by Batwoman‘s Brianne Howey) comparing herself and 15-year-old Ginny (Raising Dion‘s Antonia Gentry) to the beloved Gilmore duo.

Netflix’s Tribes of Europa is a new apocalyptic mystery created by the producers of Dark, W&b Television. The new series arrived on the streaming service on February 19th, with all six episodes available to watch now. Tribes of Europa follows a similar path to that of Dark, film franchise The Hunger Games and hit series Game of Thrones, where families set out with a mammoth mission of saving the world from further catastrophe.

Like many other great Netflix series, Tribes of Europa ends with an agonising cliffhanger. There’s currently no word about a second season, and the first finishes with plenty of questions around the plot. We’ve pulled together the answers to some burning questions below.

The way that our world is headed, with natural disasters, global warming and political big shots at constant loggerheads, would it be that hard to imagine everything we know crumbling before our eyes? Netflix’s new sci-fi drama Tribes of Europa focuses on three siblings that set out to change the course of the world after a global disaster that happened 45 years prior to 2074, when the series is set.

We’re not exactly sure how this dystopian, post-apocalyptic world came to be the norm. All that is revealed of what once was is the mention of ‘Black December’, when the lights went black and Europe was plunged into darkness.

The team behind Tribes of Europa were also the creators for Netflix’s first German-language series, Dark, and the Oscar-winning The Life of Others.

Exclusive: George R.R. Martin is bringing more dragons to HBO.

The Game of Thrones creator is exec producing a TV adaptation of Roadmarks from sci-fi novelist Roger Zelazny, which is development at the WarnerMedia cable network.

The adaptation comes from Kalinda Vazquez, who has written on Star Trek: Discovery and was a co-exec producer on Fear The Walking Dead. Vazquez, who was named after a character from the original Star Trek TV series, will write, exec produce and showrun the adaptation.

In the first week of January 2020, a remix of Saint Jhn’s “Roses” flew into Spotify’s Top 100. It spent much of the year in the same lofty position, even cracking the Top Five last April, at which point it was earning more than four million streams a day on Spotify alone.

The original “Roses” is a brittle and swaggering rap ballad, like much of Saint Jhn’s catalog; the remix, by the Kazakhstani producer Imanbek, pushes towards Eurohouse, with a bludgeoning bass line and lyrics pitched up ’til they squeak., ‘Roses’ Star Saint Jhn Aims Even Higher in 2021, /news/item/ni63199791, https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/saint-jhn-roses-interview-1129526/, 2021-02-18T18:13:28Z
‘The Crown’ star Helena Bonham Carter has joined the cast for the BBC’s new comedy series from Greg Davies ‘The Cleaner’.

Ever wondered how many pints of Guinness are drank each year? Me neither, so let’s get on with singing the praises of this wonderful crime comedy-thriller.

Pixie Hardy (Olivia Cooke) is a seemingly nice, normal girl living in a nice, normal part of Ireland. However, she’s got a drugs heist on her mind and this job’s personal. When things inevitably start to unravel, she’s forced to team-up on a road trip with Frank (Ben Hardy) and Harland (Daryl McCormack) a pair of loveable losers who are way out of their depth. And when you throw a bunch of decidedly dodgy priests into the mix, “nice, normal” goes straight out the stained-glass window.

Pixie’s strong suit is its sheer likeability. It’s poignant and somewhat gritty in places, but maintains an innocent charm throughout. As a black comedy, it would’ve also been easy to fall, Pixie (2020) Review: Snatch meets Dogma in this road trip with a difference, /news/item/ni63199185, https://roobla.com/76699/pixie-2020-review-snatch-meets-dogma-in-this-road-trip-with-a-difference/, 2021-02-18T11:32:46Z

Anyone still giddy on fumes having devoured the whole of sexy, sexy Bridgerton, might well be looking for more love machinations, posh dresses and ladies attending dances. You may well be tempted then by 2005’s Pride and Prejudice which is available to stream on Netflix. After all, this is one of the starriest and most lavish period productions around, packed with stone cold talent. The Bennett family alone boasts Carey Mulligan, Rosamund Pike, Jenna Malone, Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland as well as the movie’s star Keira Knightley. It’s directed by Joe Wright who knows his onions when it comes to period movies after Anna Karenina, Atonement and The Darkest Hour. And it goes without saying that Austen’s text is a classic romantic tome which is always a joy. Get involved!

Pedro Pascal's casting as Joel Miller in HBO's The Last of Us series has fans of The Mandalorian pretty excited, but there are many Game of Thrones fans feeling disappointed that it wasn't Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. Last week, word broke that Pascal had officially been cast as Joel to co-star in the series alongside Bella Ramsey as Ellie. Like Coster-Waldau, both are also oddly enough Game of Thrones alum.

Prior to the recent casting news, many fans were campaigning for Nikolaj Coster-Waldau to land the role of Joel. In addition to proving his acting chops on Game of Thrones, the actor is also widely perceived to look a lot like the original video game version of the character. As perhaps the frontrunner with a lot of fans of The Last of Us to play the part in the HBO series, Coster-Waldau had also been featured in a variety of fan, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Fans Are Bummed by Pedro Pascal's The Last of Us Casting as Joel, /news/item/ni63198186, https://movieweb.com/the-last-of-us-nikolaj-coster-waldau-fans-joel/, 2021-02-17T17:27:21Z

I can’t remember watching a home invasion horror movie for a long time and then two come along at once. First, I watched By Night’s End and then The Owners comes along… I wouldn’t say it’s a sub genre I love but it has produced some really great movies – the likes of The Strangers, You’re Next, Don’t Breathe, Inside and Hush are all highly entertaining.

There is a tendency for lower budget home invasion offerings to go down the same path and stick to ideas that have been used time and time again. Meaning that many feel very samey.

The weirdest sci-fi thriller of the ’80s, TerrorVision, was ahead of its time with its prediction of the era of Netflix.

“Like the rest of his warped nuclear family, Stanley Putterman (Gerrit Graham) can’t contain his excitement at the new satellite dish that will beam hundreds of channels into their ridiculously garish home. This is 1986, after all, an era when even cable could only offer a few dozen. But by the end of Ted Nicolaou’s ultra-kitsch monster mash, their insatiable appetite for the small screen has literally consumed them all.”

The weekend before last, I found myself bingeing the entire series of Firefly Lane. Not for work. Not because anybody asked me to. Just because it was new.

The series has been trending on Netflix for some weeks now and it appears to be very popular with viewers – more so than with critics – which is great, and no disrespect to anyone who loves the show. However, I personally thought it was quite bad. This isn’t a review and I’m not here for a debate on the merits – we are living in a world in crisis so anything that brings anyone joy is gold in my book.

Firefly Lane, however, did not bring me joy and yet I still felt compelled to sit through the entire thing. I also watched the whole of Emily in Paris – I liked it while fully acknowledging its trashiness. I binged the whole of, “Why am I Watching This?” Firefly Lane and the Compulsion of Newness, /news/item/ni63197590, https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/firefly-lane-netflix-newness/, 2021-02-17T08:00:00Z
Netflix psychological thriller Behind Her Eyes, adapted from Sarah Pinborough’s hit novel of the same name, sets its cast an unenviably tough task (and not just because almost everyone’s having to do a regional accent). Through subtleties and shifts in their performances, Eve Hewson, Tom Bateman, Simona Brown and Robert Aramayo need to keep the audience invested while keeping us guessing. What is it we’re watching? Is this six-part series the tale of Adele and David’s brittle marriage and the secrets that bind them? Or the story of single-mother Louise (Simona Brown) getting in over her head with this glamorous new couple? Could it be something else entirely?

While you’re asking yourself those questions, you’ll likely be asking another: where have I seen that guy before? While we can’t help with the former and stay spoiler-free, we can answer that one…

On Twitter, Druckmann posted a portrait by Andrea C. White of Pascal sporting a beard and hairstyle more reminiscent of the hardened smuggler from the video game.
